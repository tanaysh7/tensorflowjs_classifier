# TensorFlow.js Example: Training on Open and Closed Eyes

This example shows you how to train Tensorflow on Closed Eyes In The Wild (CEW) dataset.

**Data:**  [link](http://parnec.nuaa.edu.cn/xtan/data/ClosedEyeDatabases.html)

This model will compute accuracy over 1000 random test set examples every 5
steps, plotting loss and accuracy as the model is training. Training time can
be reduced by computing accuracy over fewer examples less often.

To run this on local server run 

`yarn`

`yarn watch`
